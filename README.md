# PyBer_Analysis


## 1. Overview of the analysis:

The new analysis aims to address differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.   We will achieve this by creating a     summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city types and a multiple-line graph showing each city's total weekly fares.


## 2. Results:

- Urban has the highest total rides, total drivers, and total fares.  
- Rural has the lowest total rides, total drivers, and total fares. 

- Urban has the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.  
- Rural has the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.  

- Urban has the highest total fares by city type.
- Rural has the lowest total fares by city type.

- Suburban places in the middle for all parameters. 


### The summary DataFrame

## 3. Summary:


Based on the results, I proposed three business recommendations for addressing the disparities among the city types:

1.  Transfer some urban drivers to suburban.  The average fare per ride and driver are much cheaper in urban is likely due to too many drivers and too much competition.
2.  Increase the average fare per ride in the urban area.
3.  Transfer some urban drivers to rural area, lowering the competition in the urban area. 
4.  Decrease the average fare per ride in rural.
